Ibentau is a chatbot that can be integrated into the website of a technology conference. It is capable of answering questions from participants such as the schedule, accommodation or how to submit an article. It can be trained by AI and remember the context and previous messages. Furthermore, it can also be managed by an administrator, who can set the event and the panel of responses. Finally, tools such as named entity recognition can be used to improve the efficiency of the chatbot.

## Why Ibentau ?

The name "Ibentau" was chosen to represent the chatbot's purpose. It is derived from the Japanese word ibento (ã‚¤ãƒ™ãƒ³ãƒˆ), which means "event". This reflects the idea that Ibentau can be used to provide information about events and conferences.
